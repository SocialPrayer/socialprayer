### [SocialPrayer-beta](http://wwwdev.social-prayer.com)

SocialPrayer was created to provide a place to those who wanted to pray with their loved ones as well as have an online outlet to pray. It is early in development but currently functional. 

Based on Laravel 5.3, it has been built to be scaled and built to support a large audience. The front end is built with bootstrap and scales very nicely to mobile devices. I do have a goal to port to iPhone and Android eventually as well.

## Contributing

I would greatly appreciate contributions! I have a fulltime job and 3 kids. I spend as much time as I possibly can developing SocialPrayer but there is so much I want to do. 

To contribute please create a fork and then submit a pull request from your fork.
